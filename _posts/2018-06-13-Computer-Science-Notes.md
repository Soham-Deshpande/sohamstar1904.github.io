To multiply a binary digit by 2, you do a binary shift. This is when you add a 0 at the end.


1010101010 x 2=
10101010100

1.23456 x 10⁷
That is called standard form in maths. In binary it is called a floating point.

In binary, the maximum number of "things" is 256 in 8 bit. You can only count upto 255 as you skip zero.

 



In ascii there are only 128 possibilities.

  
8 bits = 1 Byte
1024 Bytes = 1 kB
1024 kB = 1mB
1024 mB = 1GB
1024 GB = 1TB
1024 TB = 1 PetaBYte
        = 1 ExaByte
        = 1 ZetaBYte
        = 1 YottaByte




A FLOP is a floating point operation. Computers run on teraflops.



08 bit = 256   = 2⁸
16 bit = 25536 = 2¹⁶
32 bit =       = 2 32
64 bit =       = 2 64
