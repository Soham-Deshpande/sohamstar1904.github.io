To multiply a binary digit by 2, you do a binary shift. This is when you add a 0 at the end.


1010101010 x 2=
10101010100

1.23456 x 10⁷
That is called standard form in maths. In binary it is called a floating point.

In binary, the maximum number of "things" is 256 in 8 bit. You can only count upto 255 as you skip zero.

 



In ascii there are only 128 possibilities.

  
8 bits = 1 Byte
1024 Bytes = 1 kB
1024 kB = 1mB
1024 mB = 1GB
1024 GB = 1TB
1024 TB = 1 PetaBYte
        = 1 ExaByte
        = 1 ZetaBYte
        = 1 YottaByte




A FLOP is a floating point operation. Computers run on teraflops.



08 bit = 256   = 2⁸
16 bit = 25536 = 2¹⁶
32 bit =       = 2 32
64 bit =       = 2 64

Why is ascii 7 bit and unicode 8 bit?- Exam question
Unicode can encode 256 characters. Standard unicode works in 8 bit however has unicode is universal, it has to work for different languages. This adds more characters to Unicode. That is why unicode now works in 32 bit which has around 4 billion possibilities.



THE FETCH/EXECUTE/DECODE CYCLE#

How a computer works

It consists of memory and CPU. The key parts in the CPU are 

AC - Accumulator.Holds pieces of processed data
Arithmetic Logic unit-  adds, divides,multiply, greater than …
Control Unit- Decides what is going to happen

Registers:

MAR- Memory address register
CIR- Control instruction register
PC - Program counter
MAR- Memory data register
 

Assembly language is basic instruction set

The main component on any computer is the CPU, which stands for Central Processing Unit. The CPU gets instructions and then performs calculations. If a processor can only process one set of instructions at a single, that means it has only a single core.

the PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG) said that the new version "doubles the interconnect bit rate from 2.5 GT/s to 5 GT/s." Most of us are used to seeing bus speeds specified in Gbps, or gigabits per second, but GT/s stands for gigatransfers per second.



CPU-1-The central processing unit. This carries out all of the programs.
RAM-2- Random access memory. This stores data and machine code which can be called upon at any time.
MOTHERBOARD- All-The main circuit board
PCI EXPANSION-3- It is a circuit board which can be slotted in to add functionality via the expansion busNORTH BRIDGE-Reads”Gigabyte” It is a core logic chipset which is used for tasks which require the highest performance

SOUTH BRIDGE-4-It is a chipset which handles lower performance tasksBIOS- Basic input output system. It is a firmware which is used during power on of the device.STORAGE- Stores the data.

Draw the image and label the motherboard with the labels and explain in our own words.
