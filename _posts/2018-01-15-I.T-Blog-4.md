    <td>This week I worked on trying to add a voucher code. I started the lesson by going to back to my virtual shop and seeing what progress I had made. I found a good place to start and continues from there. I had made a couple of voucher codes which I wanted to implement in my virtual shop.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>I started of by just using one voucher code. With this I used  the voucher code entered = the actual voucher code. I this equaled true then it took the total and took 25% off it. This worked on the first go but the harder part for me was to add the same logic for multiple voucher codes. I tried to use the same code but change the actual voucher code to a whole column of them. This gave me an error. With this I decided to use a vlookup but it did not work for me. I started experimenting with different lines of code. This included =IF(I34=Discounts!A2,(I33-(I33*25%)),I33)  and
=iferror(vlookup(I34,Discounts!$A$2:$A$14,2,false),)
These lines did not work and as it was coming to the end of the lesson I decided to keep the codes on a different sheet and keep the code for just 1 voucher code.
