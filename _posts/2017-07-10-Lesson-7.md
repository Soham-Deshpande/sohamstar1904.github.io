    <td>I started with a project where the end goal was to use two variables. This task was quite difficult but I then realised I was using the wrong brackets when I was using a list. Then I started the battleship project where I was creating a table with values for the map.</td>

    <td>I feel that I am not using the knowledge I have learnt so I need to recap on some things including brackets as it is there where I am making lots of my mistakes.</td>
