    <td>This week in I.T we started by doing a few buzzfeed quizzes. After doing the quizzes, we got asked about how the answer may have been generated. There were a couple of ideas but the main ideas were about having: a number system, priority questions, at random and which letter you have chosen the most.  This led onto Mr.Keen telling us to make our own quiz. We got told that the methods of reaching an outcome had to be either from a number system or based on what letter you chose the most. For our quiz, there had to be a main question which gets answered using 8 questions. I chose my main question to be about what marvel character are you. My 8 side questions will be ranked from 1-4. These numbers will add up in the end and depending on what range your total falls in, that will be the outcome.</td>
