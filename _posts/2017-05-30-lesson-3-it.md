    <td>I started with a small project about creating a system which would take a word and scrambled it to make it more encrypted. This included stating variables then using the if statements to reject non letters as it would make it harder.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>When coding, I need to think more logically. This will help me in completing the harder projects such as having lots of variables running at one time. This will also help when I am using if, elseif and else statements.thank you very much </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will take my time and go slower to reduce the chances of me getting things wrong. This will also help me understand the topic more as it is getting harder. 
As mentioned above, I also need to think more logically.
