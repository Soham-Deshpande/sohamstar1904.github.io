    <td>I started to learn how to use strings as variables and then I swiftly moved onto using if and or statements. These allowed me to write more complex codes with more than 1 clauses that have to agree. I also started using if, else and if else. These helped me to pinpoint exact answers and also give answers to questions.</td>

    <td>When i had to create my own piece of code meeting all of the expectations, I struggled. I had to make sure that everything equalled to be true so I had to add in new variables and then finally after a while of trial and error.</td>
