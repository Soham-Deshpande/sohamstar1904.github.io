    <td>I started with a project where the end goal was to create a scoring system and use else system to decide the outcome of each go. This required iterating things but I struggled on indenting.</td>

    <td>I feel that I am not using the knowledge I have learnt so I need to recap on some things including brackets as it is there where I am making lots of my mistakes. Another thing I need to work on is my indenting. This is stopping me from completing loops.</td>
