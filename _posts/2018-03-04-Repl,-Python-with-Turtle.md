    <td>This week we had a switch over and so we finished learning the basics of spreadsheets and started on learning python. We used a website called Repl where you could choose a language to code in. In this we used a language called Python. This version includes a helper which was called Turtle. With Python with Turtle we started on learning how coding is like a concise set of rules which the computer will follow to make patterns. We started on talking how we tell a computer to draw a triangle. We had to find what a triangle was made up of which are 3 sides of equal shape which have an interior angle of 60.  To find a general set of code which will make any shape, we diagnosed a solution which was that by changing the angle the turtle changes by, you can construct any shape. We then went onto finding that if you divide 360 by the amount of sides a shape has, it will create any shape(apart from a circle as a computer is made up of pixels so it can never make a circle). We used an iteration so that only one line of code could make any shape.
