    <td>We started with a talk about where google sheets can be used and its advantages in the world. We got told that it makes things easier to do and makes less errors. In a shop it is very quick and very effective. We started a project where we were starting a shop and we made a simple sheet where we have different values with prices. Then in a different column we have used the function vlookup which makes the values inputted at the start as a sort of dictionary which can be called upon at any time for values of the items. </td>
