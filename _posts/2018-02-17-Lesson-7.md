    <td>We started the lesson by deciphering a code which was on the board. This consisted of a couple of letters which looked really random. After a few moments I realised this was a Caesar cipher and so I started to move all the letters back by 1 place, then 2 places, then 3 places until it revealed the phrase "Hello World". We then had to create a simple decipher  in google sheets. I decided to write out the whole alphabet and then write out 1-26 next to   It. I did this so that I could do a vlookup and then add or minus numbers to scramble up the code.  Lots of people looked it up on google and found a specific code which will do that but we got told to use our own knowledge to create it. This meant using vlookup. After that we had to create a cipher. This was done in the same way I made the decipher. I added on a random number. To send an email to someone we learnt how to compress all the numbers. This was done using concatenate. This made all the numbers in one row. To make my code harder to decipher I labeled the alphabet upto 230. I also added minus numbers.
