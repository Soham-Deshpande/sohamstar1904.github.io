    <td>We finished the project and so it was all about experimenting with the code and pre programming it to pick up things. I tried to add a password mechanism so only some people could use it. We looked back on some things to do the pre programming. This will be about using 0 and 1.</td>

    <td>This week, we struggled at the start to get our code to work. We had a lot of errors coming up so we reviewed it and found out that there was a problem with the fuze box and the robot arm. When pre programming the robot arm, we realised that we had to manually change the code to zero to make it stop. Later on, we used the wait command</td>

    <td>Next time I try and use all the knowledge we learnt to make the robot arm do or write out things without us touching the controls. This could trigger a race for example.
