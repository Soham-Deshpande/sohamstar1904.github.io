    <td>With the alarms, it was about having a specific digit where it would trigger an alarm. We had to set it up in an specific way then when we put our hand near a special al resistor, it would detect the difference in light and would go off. At the end, we reached the robot arm but to consolidate what we knew, we experimented with previous codes like trying to add a button.</td>

    <td>This week, we didn't experiment very much and rushed a bit so we need to take it slower and experiment more as the next project is the robot arm where will have to use our own knowledge.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and go more slowly. This is the same target as last week so I need to empathise on it. I need to experiment to make sure I know everything and I am prepared to do the robot arm.</td>
