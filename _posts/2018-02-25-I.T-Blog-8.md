    <td>This week we started on finding a better way to encrypt a set of data. This is when we came across ASCII. We had to search up what this was. After searching it, we found out that it used in computers to translate binary into full stops, question marks and everything that is on a keyboard. By using the ascii, we could encode something in binary and then convert it back into characters. While doing this we had to figure out a way to create all the digits into 8 digit binary. This was done using DEC2BIN. After that we used a vlookup to find the character in the ascii table and then convert it.
