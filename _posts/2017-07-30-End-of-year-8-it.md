**End of Year 8 I.T**

Overall year 8 has been a year where I have learnt many languages and how to code methodically and work systematically. I have learnt how to code a robot and how to use a motherboard. I have also learnt python. 

In coding robots, it tested my determination with using a lot of trial and error. Things I feel I have improved on in coding robots is using trial and error but doing it in a systematic way. This helped make the robot move without us using the controls. Want I want to improve on is working within time

.

In learning python, I worked within time and finished as much as you had with a lot of time to spare. I worked very quickly and swiftly but at the same time I Went back and looked at previous units to make sure I remember them. What I want to work on next year is using all the buttons and keys when I should use them for example when indenting.
