    <td>We worked in pairs. Between us we had a manual. We used the manual until we understood the concept, then we started changing things around to see if we really understood what the code does. This helped us as when we are going to start the robot arm, we will know what all the code does so it will make it easier for us to code it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes I didn't think the piece of code I was trying it write logically. This included trying to use variables when I hadn't set up a specific variable at the start of the code. I need to work on my variables as these will be very crucial on every piece of code.</td>

    <td>Next time I will experiment more and try to use the time I have wisely so I can reach the full amount. This will help me as I would be able to organise my time in the project.</td>
