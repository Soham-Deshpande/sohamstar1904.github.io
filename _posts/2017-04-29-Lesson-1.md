    <td>I did tutorials on codecademy on how to use python. The first parts were about Boolean, Strings and variables. These exercises mainly focused on your reading skills and throughout the code, it tested me on what I have learnt with mini quizzes.</td>

    <td>I need to work on using logic and reading the instructions carefully. On some parts, I could not figure out the answer but then I realised that I had written in the variable wrongly.</td>

    <td>Next time I will take my time and go slower to reduce the chances of me getting things wrong. Then later on, I can build up speed and still do things correctly.</td>
