    <td>We started by recapping what we did last lesson which was using vlookup to have data which can be used somewhere else. After that Mr.Tansley introduced us to discounts. This was very mathematically based. We used the greater than sign to be used when the customer spends Â£750 or more then you get a 25% discount. This meant multiplying the grand total by 0.25.</td>
