    <td>This week was the same as last week. We had finished the robot arm project so we had to experiment. We continued from last time and tried to pre-programme the robot arm to pick up objects and place them somewhere else.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We had to adjust the object that was going to be picked up many times because it would just miss. We had to be patient but in the end, it never did pick up the object.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I try and use all the knowledge we learnt to make the robot arm do or write out things without us touching the controls. This could trigger a race for example. This was the last week so I will be doing codecademy next time.</td>
